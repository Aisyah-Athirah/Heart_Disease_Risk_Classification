# heartdisease

  This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the risk of heart disease using a comprehensive dataset of personal health indicators. The dataset includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle attributes sourced from Kaggle. The methodology involves rigorous data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to enhance model performance. Random Forest was chosen as the Classification algorithms to evaluate for the predictive accuracy and robustness. Model training is conducted using optimized hyperparameters and evaluated using a range of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. The results highlight the efficacy of machine learning in risk assessment for heart disease, providing valuable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers. This project aims to contribute to early intervention strategies and improve patient outcomes through data-driven approaches.
